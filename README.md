# Interviewing at Uryclea
Thank you for your interest in Uryclea! We're excited to learn more about you. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of our interview process to help you prepare effectively. While we continuously work to improve our process, it is designed to help both you and our team determine if there's a strong mutual fit.

## The Interview Process

Our interview process is comprehensive and transparent, designed to help both you and us make an informed decision. We strive to make it engaging and valuable for all candidates, and we welcome your feedback throughout the process.

The process typically consists of three main stages:

1. Initial Conversation
   - A founding team member will have an introductory call with you
   - While we often reach out to candidates directly, we welcome applications through all channels

2. On-site Technical Interview
   - If there's strong mutual interest, we'll invite you to spend a day working with our team
   - We'll cover your travel expenses and arrange the visit at your convenience
   - The day includes hands-on technical work with our team
   - *As part of our commitment to open source, we'll donate the equivalent of one day's pay to an open-source project of your choice*

3. Final Discussion
   - We'll review compensation and logistics
   - Since we discuss key details throughout the process, there shouldn't be any unexpected elements at this stage

You're welcome to conclude the process at any point if you determine Uryclea isn't the right fit for you. Similarly, we'll be upfront if we don't see a strong match, respecting everyone's time.

## Preparation

### Technical Practice Guidelines

#### General Programming Skills
- Focus on building a complete project from scratch (estimated time: 2-4 hours)
- Example project: Create a CLI tool that generates ASCII art or fractals
- Recommended Python framework: Typer
- Key areas to practice:
  - Object-oriented programming (classes and inheritance)
  - Python idioms (list/dict comprehensions)
  - Control flow and basic syntax
  
#### Machine Learning Focus
- Essential skills:
  - PyTorch and/or NumPy proficiency
  - Tensor operations (dimension manipulation, argmax, etc.)
  - Understanding of backpropagation (both practical implementation and theory)
- Note: While theoretical knowledge is valuable, our focus is on practical application

#### Frontend Development
- Recommended: Build a sample project using Next.js
- Note: While Next.js knowledge is beneficial, it's not a requirement
- We value:
  - Technical reasoning and discussion
  - Ability to evaluate and critique technical choices
  - Well-supported alternative approaches

## Evaluation Criteria

### Core Focus Areas

#### Technical Understanding & Problem Solving
- Understanding and addressing the core challenges of problems
- Developing functional, well-reasoned solutions
- Demonstrating awareness of trade-offs in technical decisions
- Ability to explain your thought process and decisions

#### Code Quality
- Clear, logical code structure and organization
- Appropriate use of abstractions and design patterns
- Functional implementation that can be demonstrated
- Basic performance considerations (not specifically O(n) complexity)

#### Communication
- Asking clarifying questions via the designated Slack channel
- Explaining assumptions and design choices
- Providing basic instructions for running/testing your solution
- Discussing technical trade-offs

### Opportunities to Excel
- Feel free to showcase expertise in specific areas:
  - Specialized libraries
  - Threading and async programming
  - NumPy optimization
  - Other relevant technical skills
- We value seeing your strengths in action during the practical work session

### What We Don't Require
- Complete unit test coverage
- Comprehensive type hints
- Extensive performance optimizations
- Detailed analysis or benchmarking
- Perfect knowledge of all topics

### Important Notes
- Focus on demonstrating your problem-solving approach rather than memorized knowledge
- We evaluate both technical skills and how you work through new challenges
- Questions and clarifications are viewed positively
- Documentation of intentionally skipped optimizations is welcome
